- 📜 I graduated in Design with a Post-graduation in Web Design.

- 💜 My strongest quality: being sensitive to UI/UX and having a back-ground in Design/Web makes me more knowledgeable of what I can or can't do, or what takes more or less time to develop with my Front-end skills, which in turn allows me to manage my tasks.
- 💛 My worst quality: stuburn, I have to know why something works, how it's working, how I can make it work, or I won't let it go until I do understand.
- 👍 I do volunteer work as a TED Translator.
- 📚 I'm currently learning GraphQL.
